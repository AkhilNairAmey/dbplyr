# dplyr 0.1.2.0.99

## Bug fixes

* `select()` renames columns in a data table (#284).

* `rbind_all()` and `rbind_list()` did not handle missing values in factors (#279).

* SQL joins now work better if names duplicated in both x and y tables (#310)

# dplyr 0.1.2

## New features

* `select()` is substantially more powerful. You can use named arguments to
  rename existing variables, and new functions `starts_with()`, `ends_with()`,
  `contains()`, `matches()` and `num_range()` to select variables based on
  their names. It now also makes a shallow copy, substantially reducing its
  memory impact (#158, #172, #192, #232).

* `summarize()` added as alias for `summarise()` for people from countries
  that don't don't spell things correctly ;) (#245)

## Bug fixes

* `filter()` now fails when given anything other than a logical vector, and
  correctly handles missing values (#249). `filter.numeric()` proxies
  `stats::filter()` so you can continue to use `filter()` function with
  numeric inputs (#264).

* `summarise()` correctly uses newly created variables (#259).

* `mutate()` correctly propagates attributes (#265) and `mutate.data.frame()`
  correctly mutates the same variable repeatedly (#243).

* `lead()` and `lag()` preserve attributes, so they now work with
  dates, times and factors (#166).

* `n()` never accepts arguments (#223).

* `row_number()` gives correct results (#227).

* `rbind_all()` silently ignores data frames with 0 rows or 0 columns (#274).

* `group_by()` orders the result (#242). It also checks that columns
  are of supported types (#233, #276).

* The hybrid evaluator did not handle some expressions correctly, for
  example in `if(n() > 5) 1 else 2` the subexpression `n()` was not
  substituted correctly. It also correctly processes `$` (#278).

* `arrange()` checks that all columns are of supported types (#266). It also
  handles list columns (#282).

* Working towards Solaris compatibility.

* Benchmarking vignette temporarily disabled due to microbenchmark
  problems reported by BDR.

# dplyr 0.1.1

## Improvements

* new `location()` and `changes()` functions which provide more information
  about how data frames are stored in memory so that you can see what
  gets copied.

* renamed `explain_tbl()` to `explain()` (#182).

* `tally()` gains `sort` argument to sort output so highest counts
  come first (#173).

* `ungroup.grouped_df()`, `tbl_df()`, `as.data.frame.tbl_df()` now only
  make shallow copies of their inputs (#191).

* The `benchmark-baseball` vignette now contains fairer (including grouping
  times) comparisons with `data.table`. (#222)

## Bug fixes

* `filter()` (#221) and `summarise()` (#194) correctly propagate attributes.

* `summarise()` throws an error when asked to summarise an unknown variable
  instead of crashing (#208).

* `group_by()` handles factors with missing values (#183).

* `filter()` handles scalar results (#217) and better handles scoping, e.g.
  `filter(., variable)` where `variable` is defined in the function that calls
  `filter`. It also handles `T` and `F` as aliases to `TRUE` and `FALSE`
  if there are no `T` or `F` variables in the data or in the scope.

* `select.grouped_df` fails when the grouping variables are not included
  in the selected variables (#170)

* `all.equal.data.frame()` handles a corner case where the data frame has
  `NULL` names (#217)

* `mutate()` gives informative error message on unsupported types (#179)

* dplyr source package no longer includes pandas benchmark, reducing
  download size from 2.8 MB to 0.5 MB.
